## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

Media Box is a marketplace and music player on your mobile phone. It protects the right of the music to be avoid downloading and sharing for free. 
In Media Box, every music is copyright protected by UDAP’s Proxy Re-Encryption(PRE) modules. PRE schemes are cryptosystems which allow third parties to alter a cipher content which has been encrypted for one party, so that it may be decrypted by another. PRE ensures that nobody can download a music for free, and the shared music can’t be shared to any other parties. You can also share the bought music to your friend but you can’t listen the music during that time.
Media Box allows musicians sell their own limited-edition music in the marketplace, users can buy and resell the music to other users too, allows the music to be priced right with the marketed value. Musician can enjoy the 20% of the resell price automatically. 
Media Box starts from music first, and it can spread to other media types, like pictures, movies, and online novels, etc.
